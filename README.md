##Introduction

Learn more about [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu).

This code is designed to be run in Google's App Engine. It is a fork
of MIT App Inventor's official instance that contains a privacy description
generator for all App Inventor project. For more details on this
PrivacyInformer tool, please see Daniela Miao's thesis [here](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2014/Theses/ThesisDanielaMiao.pdf).

MIT runs an official public instance that all are welcome to use to 
build App Inventor Applications. You do not need to compile or use 
this code if you wish to build MIT App Inventor applications without
the privacy description generator.

We provide this code for reference and for experienced people who wish
to operate their own App Inventor instance and/or contribute to the project.

This code is tested and known to work with Java 7.

Check out the open source [site](http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/) to find a lot more information about how to compile, build and run this code.
